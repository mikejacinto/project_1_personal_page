        <p>Graphic Designer and aspiring web designer who loves providing creative solutions. For the past ten years I have been doing graphic and web design for churches. I have experience in print, digital, motion and web design.</p>
        <p>For some time now, I've had the desire to learn web development to add to my skill set as a designer. Web development seems be a career that is in high demand and I'm excited to see where it can take me.</p>

        <h2 class="goals">Goals</h2>
        <p>I've dabbled in building pre-built, Wordpress themed websites but now I want to learn to build websites from scratch. With my experience in design, I believe front-end devolpment would be a good starting point for me.</p>

        <p>No matter who I eventually work for, I would like to create websites that provide a great user experience. Evenutally I would also like to learn back-end web development and become a full-stack developer.</p>
